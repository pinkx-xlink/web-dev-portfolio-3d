### _Desktop View_

**Welcome to my 2026 web development portfolio**, where I'm excited to share some of my favorite projects I've built so far.

## Languages & Tools used

I started building my portfolio with ReactJS & Vite as the scaffolding (and, of course, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as essential building blocks), ThreeJS for the 3D models, GSAP for the smooth animations, and TailwindCSS for responsiveness and to ensure that the site looks great on the user's end whether they view the page on desktop, mobile, or tablet.

## Challenges

I had to do some serious brainstorming when it came to deciding on the layout I wanted for my Projects section, and I faced some difficulties with importing te 3D models. I also had to battle with the EmailJS add-on due to conflicting dependencies in the package.json, but a little Googling, uninstalling, and re-installing took care of that. The true challenge appeared once I deployed the project to Netlify for live hosting.

## The Solution

Thanks to Google, Netlify debugging tips, and my sheer determination, my portfolio was up and running, live and online at long last! I've had issues deploying **specifically ReactJS** projects to Netlify before, but this project taught me that the process generally goes smoother when I deploy my websites through the terminal using NPM commands and sync it to the repository instead of manually deploying the static folder on the Netlify website.

## What I Learned

This project was full of firsts, including the 3D ThreeJS models and the animatd icon carousel (which I'm very happy about, because the last time I tried to build an icon carousel it didn't go as well 😅). There were also plenty of opportunities for me to get additional practice with tools I started using recently but still have plenty to learn about, including GSAP animations. And to my surprise, building my portfolio helped me feel like I'm rapidly becoming a TailwindCSS expert! I started studying TailwindCSS a few months ago on a whim, and after seeing how easy it was to use it to make my portfolio look great on all devices, I'd rather not think about my development life before Tailwind! Last but not least, after completing this website, I'm confident that I could import and use Lucide React components in my sleep.
