Welcome to my 2026 web development portfolio, where I'm excited to share some of my favorite projects I've built so far.
I started building my portfolio with ReactJS & Vite as the scaffolding, ThreeJS for the 3D models, GSAP for the smooth animations, and TailwindCSS for responsiveness and to ensure that the site looks great on the user's end whether they view the page on desktop, mobile, or tablet.
